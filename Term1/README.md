# 🎓 My University Learning Path

This repository documents my learning journey as a Computer Science student at Payam Noor University.  
My goal is to understand each subject conceptually and connect it to real-world programming — especially React and TypeScript.  

## 📚 Current Term
**Term 1 Courses:**
- Calculus 1 (ریاضی عمومی ۱)
- Physics 1 (فیزیک پایه ۱)
- Programming Fundamentals (مبانی کامپیوتر و برنامه‌سازی)
- Computer Workshop (کارگاه کامپیوتر)
- Discrete Mathematics (ریاضیات گسسته)
- Logic Circuits (مدارهای منطقی)

## 🧠 My Approach
For each course, I:
1. Summarize the key concepts in simple language.
2. Find free and practical learning resources.
3. Apply the concepts in my own programming projects.

✨ *My main focus:* connecting academic learning to real coding experience.

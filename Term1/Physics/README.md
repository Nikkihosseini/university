# Physics 1 - Mechanics (فیزیک پایه ۱)

### Application in Programming
Physics helps in understanding movement, forces, and motion — especially useful for:
- Game development and simulations
- Creating realistic animations and transitions
- Physics-based effects in React Canvas or Three.js

### Learning Resources
